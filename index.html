        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
          first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
          non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript
          is a
          prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
          The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript
          5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
          the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially
          referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles.
          This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
          trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
          programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.

        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your
          websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
        <p>
          However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML
          and
          CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add
          JavaScript
          to your page for creating a Hello world! example.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new directory to store the website in.</li>
          <li>Create a file in the directory named <code>index.html</code> </li>
          <li>Create another file named <code>main.js</code> </li>
          <li>Include this <code>&lt;script src=&quot;./main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script"&gt;</code> inside
            your HTML file.</li>
          <li>Now add this code to your <code>main.js</code> file:
            <code class="block"><code class="block">
                  function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>
                  greetMe("World");
              </code></code>
          </li>
          <li>Open up your <span>index.html</span> file in a browser to run the JavaScript code you've written
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>

      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>

        <p> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
          identifiers, conform to certain rules.

          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
          characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
          characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>You can declare variables using <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code></p>
        <p>Example:
          <code class="block">
                  let x = 5;<br>
                  const name = "Etsh";<br>
                  var greet = hello;
              </code>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. (true and false)</li>
              <li> null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
                null
                is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Hello"</li>
              <li> Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
          with
          your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application
          can
          perform.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
      <header>Comments</header>
      <article>
        <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
        <code class="block">
          // a one line comment<br/>

          /* this is a longer,<br>
          * multi-line comment<br>
          */
          </code>
        <p>
          Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.
