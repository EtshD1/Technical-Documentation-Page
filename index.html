        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
          first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
          non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript
          is a
          prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>

          The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript
          5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
          the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially
          referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles.
          This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.

          Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
          trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
          programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.
